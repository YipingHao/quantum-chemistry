	This program(library) is wrote for scientific reasearch usage by Yiping Hao who began his graduate career since 2019.
	When the code was writen, the author was working for Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics in researcher Donghui Zhang's group.
	Its usages are beyond the research fields of Donghui Zhang's group. And it's not the crucial codes of Donghui Zhang's group.
    Thus the author gives up its copyright.
    Anyone who uses it in his/her research should express gratitude in his/her corresponding published papers.
